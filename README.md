# Museum-s-Database

This project implements a database-driven platform that supports the paradigm of Citizen Curation, a participatory model that allows users to apply curatorial methods to museum collections and develop personal interpretations. The platform empowers users to create, share, and reflect on personal stories inspired by artworks, fostering inclusivity and critical reflection through an Interpretation-Reflection Loop (IRL).

Users can explore a museum's contemporary art collection, select 2-3 artworks, and create personalized stories by adding comments, hashtags, and emojis to express their emotions and reflections. The stories, which can be voted on by other users, help build a communal dialogue around diverse interpretations. The system suggests similar or contrasting stories based on the emotional content using Plutchikâ€™s emotional model, enhancing the user's exploration of emotional diversity.

Additionally, museum curators manage the platform by enriching the catalogue, moderating content, and utilizing statistical tools to gain insights into user engagement. The platform also supports accessible features for vulnerable users, offering an alternative interface with audio descriptions and simplified interactions.

This project aims to promote empathy, cohesion, and inclusion, contrasting the divisive nature of standard social media algorithms, and to enhance user engagement with art through intuitive, emotion-based interactions.
